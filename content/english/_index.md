  description: "Born in the world of biometric and biomechanical signal processing, Qumio was created with a clear goal: to make advanced information processing techniques available to anyone, in order to get the most out of the available data."

  content: "Sensors offer us the ability to \"see the invisible\": through appropriate data processing and trend analysis, it is possible to acquire valuable information that would otherwise go completely unnoticed.


  At Qumio, we are aware of the problem that can arise from the interpretation of the raw data acquired and its transformation into quantifiable parameters that can be applied on a day-to-day basis. That is why we offer cutting-edge solutions that help our clients to obtain the qualitative and quantitative results required to analyze the desired activity.


  We believe in maintaining a close and trusting relationship with our customers in order to fully tailor data processing and acquisition to their specific needs.
